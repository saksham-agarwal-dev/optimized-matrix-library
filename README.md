# numc

### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 1
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 10
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>No, we did not find this project interesting. We have already worked a lot with matrices and did not find it interesting to do it again. The most interesting aspect was the experience of creating a clone of numpy.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>We learned how to optimize code. We also learned the struggles of teamwork and managing deadlines. This project is due in a very busy time of the year and worsened the time constraints, presenting us with a learning opportunity.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>It would be better if there is more information for optimization.</b>
